  "description": "This was the outcome of learning Quill, and at the same time needing videos to be resizeable. Im sure this could be done better as a module, but when I started building it, I started it as a format not knowing what it would turn into. I may eventually move it into a module, but I'm not making any promises. Feel free to fork and knock it out.",
